Photooasis is a photography website that I designed and coded myself to address the need for a visually engaging platform where photographers can showcase their work. The website offers four key pages: the Homepage, which introduces the brand; the Stories page, where photographers can share the narratives behind their photos; the Features page, highlighting unique offerings; and the Pricing page, detailing service costs.
